# Using Unix and vi # 

A few basic Unix commands are all that is necessary to be able to work with files. 

First, all of these commands must be typed into the Terminal. Its icon is a black square with '>_' in white. On Debian, it is located at Applications > Accessories > Terminal. After typing the command, press Enter.  

'ls' lists the files in the current directory. The '-al' option shows hidden files and displays the files as a list. 

```console
ls
ls -al
```



'cd' means change directory. It can be used in several ways. 

Used alone, it moves to the current user's home directory. This is useful if you are looking at files somewhere else and need to go back to the home directory without typing the whole path. 

```console
cd
```
